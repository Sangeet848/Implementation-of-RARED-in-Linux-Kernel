# Implementation of RARED algorithm in Linux kernel
## Course Code: CS822	<br/>
## Assignment: #FP8	<br/>

### Overview		<br/>
Refined Adaptive RED (RARED) [1] is an extension of ARED [2]. It inherits all the properties of ARED but with a minor improvement in adaptive setting of Pmax. This repository contains an implementation of RARED in the Linux kernel.
